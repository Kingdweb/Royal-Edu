        What is Agriculture? Agriculture means all the activities involved in
        rearing of animals and cultivation of crops for man's and the nation's
        benefits. The word agriculture was derived from two Latin words which
        are 'agar' and 'culture' meaning 'land' and 'cultivation'. Agriculture
        is often defined by many people as the cultivation of land. As a
        science, it deals with the systematic study of plants and animal lives
        in their environment and seeks to provide natural conditions for them so
        as to produce the best quality which are used directly or indirectly by
        man.
        <p>
          HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agriculture began when man
          started to exist on earth. The early men lived by gathering wild fruit
          and hunting wild animals because they are wanderers. The type and
          quantity available at that time was irregular and uncertain and was
          subject to the prevailing weather and luck. They continued with this
          nomadic life until large population of the families and properties
          necessitated the building of huts, so they changed from their nomadic
          way of life to a more settled life. Agriculture and its practices i.e
          farming started by accident about 12,000 years ago, when the early men
          discovered that seed and other propagative parts of remains of their
          food germinate, grow to maturity and reproduce their kinds, they also
          discovered that certain animals were friendly, so they began to
          domesticate them. Moreover crops and animals from different parts
          spread to other countries by the early missionaries, explorers and
          traders. Agriculture has undergone significant developments since the
          time of the earliest cultivation. The Fertile Crescent of Western
          Asia, Egypt and India were sites of the earliest planned sowing and
          harvesting of plants that had previously been gathered in the wild.
          Independent development of agriculture occurred in northern and
          southern China, Africaâ€™s Sahel, New Guinea, parts of India and several
          regions of America. Agricultural techniques such as irrigation, crop
          rotation, the application of fertilizers were developed soon after the
          Neolithic Revolution but have made significant strides in the past 200
          years. The Haber-Bosch method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate
          represented a major breakthrough and allowed crop yields to overcome
          previous constraints. In the past century, agriculture in the
          developed nations, and to a lesser extent in the developing world, has
          been characterized by enhanced productivity, the replacement of human
          labor by synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, selective breeding, and
          mechanization. The recent history of agriculture has been closely tied
          with a range of political issues including water pollution, biofuels,
          genetically modified organisms, tariffs, and farm subsidies.

        Week 2: Forms Of Agriculture
        <p>
          Agriculture is defined as the cultivation of the land to produce crops
          and the rearing of animals for man's use. Agriculture has many
          branches. The form of agriculture practiced in an area depends on the
          size of the farm, purpose, availability of land, the type of soil in
          the area, topography of the land and the prevailing climatic
          condition.
        </p>

        <p>
          Crop Farming : A crop is a plant grown for a specific purpose. Farming
          is the center of activity where land is cultivated for the production
          of either plants or animals or both. Crop farming therefore involves
          the cultivation of land for the production of useful crops for the
          benefit of man. When different types of crops are planted on the same
          piece of land, it is called Mixed Cropping. Crops that may be planted
          are maize, cowpea, yam, cocoa yam, groundnut, soya bean, tomato,
          pepper, okra, sorghum and some perennial crops.
        </p>
        <p>
          Horticulture: This is the study of how to grow fruits, vegetables and
          ornamental plants. It is a special branch of crop science which is not
          well developed in Nigeria. Those who specialize in the production of
          fruits, vegetables and flowers are called horticulturists. Fruits and
          Vegetables grown by horticulturists include citrus, pawpaw, mango,
          guava, cashew, pineapple, plantain, garden egg, tomato, lettuce,
          cabbage, pumpkin, cucumber, cashew, banana. Ornamental plants grown
          are hibiscus, croton, rose flowers, zinnia, hyacinth, iris, lily,
          Queen of the night. Ornamental crops are used for beautifying our
          surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Livestock farming: This is the system of keeping or rearing different
          farm animals for different purposes. Animals commonly kept include
          cattle, poultry, sheep, goats, pigs. Livestock farming may be settled
          (ranching) or unsettled (normadic herding).
        </p>
        <p>
          Bee Farming: Apiculture or Bee farming is the process of deliberately
          keeping or cultivating bees in wooden boxes or hives for different
          reasons.
        </p>
        <p>Types of Bees</p>
        <p>
          1. Solitary Bees - Most bees in the world are solitary. Mated female
          live alone in a hole or burrow into well drained soil or soft brick
          mortar. They have a short life span. Adults live for about 6 to 8
          weeks. They do not sting because they do not store honey. Solitary
          bees are used for pollinating flowers.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Bumble Bees - These bees live together in colonies and store honey
          and pollen in wax as food to be used in times of food shortage. There
          are two types; Bombus bumble bees and Cuckoo bumble bees. Bombus have
          three social classes, a female queen, partially developed female
          workers and male drones. A colony can contain 1 queen, 300 workers and
          a few drones. Cuckoo have the males and females living separately
          except during the period of mating. They have no workers. 3.Honey Bees
          - They live as a large colony in a large cavity or man made hives.
          They have three castes, 1 queen, 70,000 wakers and 300 male drones. At
          the center, the queen bee lays eggs which develop into workers. The
          drone eggs are laid later. A typical honey bee hive may contain 1
          queen 250 to 300 drones 20,000 female forages 40,000 female house bees
          5000 to 7000 eggs 7000 to 11000 larvae being fed 16,000 to 24,000
          larvae developing into eggs Importance of Bee Farming 1. Bees are
          pollinators of crops and this is important for genetic stability 2.
          Bees are kept for honey, bee wax, pollen and propolis which are used
          for food, medicine or manufacturing other products.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The social life of honey bee colony provides a strong basis for the
          study of the structure of societies.
        </p>
        <p>4. Bees are used for research and education.</p>
